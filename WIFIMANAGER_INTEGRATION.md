# WiFiManager Integration - Smart Fan System

## Overview

This implementation integrates WiFiManager functionality into both the ESP32 Smart Fan device and the Android companion app, providing a seamless WiFi configuration experience without breaking existing functionality.

## ESP32 Implementation

### Features Added:
1. **WiFiManager Library Integration**: Uses tzapu/WiFiManager for captive portal WiFi configuration
2. **Automatic WiFi Connection**: Attempts to connect to previously saved credentials
3. **Fallback Access Point**: Creates "SmartFan-[ChipID]" AP when no saved credentials exist
4. **WiFi Reset Button**: Hold BOOT button (GPIO 0) for 5 seconds to reset WiFi settings
5. **Custom Parameters**: Device ID configuration through the setup portal
6. **Non-blocking Operation**: WiFi setup doesn't interfere with sensor readings and control functions

### Files Modified:
- `SmartFan.ino`: Added WiFi reset button handling
- `FirebaseConfig.h`: Added WiFiManager support and new methods
- `FirebaseConfig.cpp`: Implemented WiFiManager initialization and configuration
- `PinConfig.h`: Added WiFi reset button pin definition

### Installation Requirements:
Install these libraries in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO:
```
- WiFiManager by tzapu (v0.16.0+)
- ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon (v6.21.3+)
```

### Usage Flow:
1. **First Boot**: ESP32 creates access point "SmartFan-[ChipID]" with password "smartfan123"
2. **Connect**: User connects to this network
3. **Configure**: Captive portal opens at 192.168.4.1 for WiFi configuration
4. **Save**: ESP32 saves credentials and connects to home WiFi
5. **Future Boots**: Automatically connects to saved network
6. **Reset**: Hold BOOT button for 5 seconds to reset and reconfigure

## Android Implementation

### Features Added:
1. **WiFi Network Scanning**: Scans and displays available WiFi networks
2. **Network Selection Interface**: Material Design UI for network selection
3. **Smart Fan AP Detection**: Automatically detects SmartFan access points
4. **Configuration Interface**: Sends WiFi credentials to ESP32 configuration portal
5. **Integration with Device Linking**: Seamlessly integrated into existing device setup flow
6. **Permission Management**: Handles all required WiFi permissions

### Files Added:
- `WiFiSetupActivity.java`: Main WiFi configuration activity
- `WiFiNetworkAdapter.java`: RecyclerView adapter for WiFi networks
- `activity_wifi_setup.xml`: WiFi setup activity layout
- `item_wifi_network.xml`: WiFi network item layout
- `security_tag_background.xml`: Drawable for security tags

### Files Modified:
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: Added WiFi permissions and WiFiSetupActivity
- `activity_device_link.xml`: Added WiFi setup card
- `DeviceLinkActivity.java`: Added WiFi setup button integration

### Permissions Added:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

### Usage Flow:
1. **Device Linking Screen**: User sees new "WiFi Setup" option
2. **WiFi Scanning**: App scans for available networks and SmartFan APs
3. **Network Selection**: User selects target WiFi network
4. **Credential Entry**: User enters WiFi password and optional device ID
5. **SmartFan Connection**: App connects to SmartFan access point
6. **Configuration**: App sends WiFi credentials to ESP32 via HTTP
7. **Completion**: ESP32 reboots and connects to home WiFi

## Integration Workflow

### Complete Setup Process:
1. **ESP32 Setup Mode**: New ESP32 boots and creates access point
2. **Android Detection**: User opens Smart Fan app, navigates to device linking
3. **WiFi Setup**: User taps "Setup WiFi" button
4. **Network Scanning**: App scans for networks and detects SmartFan AP
5. **Configuration**: User selects home WiFi and enters credentials
6. **Transfer**: App connects to SmartFan AP and sends configuration
7. **Connection**: ESP32 receives config, connects to home WiFi
8. **Device Linking**: User returns to device linking and enters device ID
9. **Complete**: ESP32 is connected to WiFi and linked to user account

### Error Handling:
- **No SmartFan AP Found**: App guides user to put device in setup mode
- **Connection Timeout**: App retries connection and shows error messages
- **Invalid Credentials**: ESP32 returns to AP mode for reconfiguration
- **Permission Denied**: App requests permissions and explains requirements

## Preserved Functionality

### ESP32:
- ✅ All sensor readings (DHT, current, voltage) continue working
- ✅ Firebase integration remains functional
- ✅ PID control and fan speed management unchanged
- ✅ TRIAC module control preserved
- ✅ Buzzer notifications still active
- ✅ Data logging to Firebase continues

### Android:
- ✅ All existing UI components preserved
- ✅ Device management features intact
- ✅ Real-time monitoring unchanged
- ✅ Firebase authentication maintained
- ✅ History and settings screens unaffected
- ✅ Material Design theme consistent

## Testing Scenarios

### Successful Setup:
1. Fresh ESP32 device creates access point
2. Android app detects and connects to SmartFan AP
3. WiFi credentials successfully transferred
4. ESP32 connects to home WiFi and is discoverable
5. Device linking completes successfully

### Error Recovery:
1. WiFi credentials incorrect → ESP32 returns to AP mode
2. Network connection lost → ESP32 attempts reconnection
3. Factory reset → Hold BOOT button for 5 seconds
4. Permission issues → App guides user through permission setup

## Security Considerations

- SmartFan AP uses WPA2 with password "smartfan123"
- Configuration portal only accessible when device is in setup mode
- WiFi credentials encrypted during transmission
- Device automatically exits setup mode after successful configuration
- Reset capability requires physical button press

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. QR code configuration for easier setup
2. Bluetooth-based configuration as fallback
3. Advanced network diagnostics
4. Multiple network configuration support
5. Remote WiFi reconfiguration via app
