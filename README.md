# SmartFan: IoT Stand Fan Automation & Android App

---

## Recent Updates (September 2025)

- **TRIACModule PWM Integration:**
   - Added `TRIACModule.h` and `TRIACModule.cpp` in `source/esp/SmartFan/` for PWM-based TRIAC control of the fan.
   - Integrated the new module into `SmartFan.ino` for easy testing and future expansion.
   - The TRIACModule allows direct PWM control of a TRIAC for fan speed, replacing potentiometer-based dimming logic.
   - Example test code in `SmartFan.ino` sweeps TRIAC power from 0% to 100% and back for validation.
   - This update is based on the RobotDyn Dimmer library logic, adapted for PWM and ESP32 compatibility.

Refer to the new files and the updated `SmartFan.ino` for implementation details.

SmartFan is a complete IoT solution for automating and monitoring a standard-size stand fan using an ESP32 microcontroller and a companion Android app. It features:

- Automatic fan speed control based on temperature (PID algorithm)
- Real-time temperature, humidity, current, and voltage monitoring
- Buzzer alerts for over-temperature
- Firebase integration for cloud data logging and remote control
- Dynamic Wi-Fi configuration using WiFiManager
- Android app for real-time monitoring, control, notifications, and device management

All hardware abstraction, control logic, and app features are modularized for easy maintenance and extension.

## ESP32 Firmware Features

- **Automatic Fan Speed Control**: PID-based adjustment of fan speed according to temperature.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: DHT22 sensor for environmental data.
- **Current & Voltage Monitoring**: ACS712 and ZMPT101B sensors for power usage and safety.
- **Buzzer Alerts**: Audible warning if temperature exceeds setpoint.
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time upload of all sensor and control data.
- **Wi-Fi Credentials Management**: User-friendly setup via WiFiManager captive portal.
- **Modular Codebase**: Each hardware component and logic is encapsulated in its own module.

---

## Android App Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication (email/password).
- **Device Linking**: Link your ESP32-powered fan by entering or scanning a Device ID. Each device is associated with a user account in Firebase.
- **Dashboard**: Real-time temperature display (animated gauge), fan status, manual and auto fan speed controls.
- **Settings & Device Management**: Light/dark mode, set temperature thresholds, manage linked devices, account management.
- **History & Logs**: View historical temperature and fan speed logs (last 50 entries).
- **Notifications**: Push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for alerts (e.g., temperature threshold exceeded).
- **Security**: Firebase security rules restrict data access to authenticated users and device owners. Input validation throughout the app.

## System Architecture

- **ESP32 Device**: Reads temperature, controls fan via TRIAC/VFD, communicates with Firebase.
- **Android App**: Modern Material UI, Firebase integration, real-time updates, device management.
- **Firebase Backend**: Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Messaging (for notifications).

- **ZMPT101B Voltage Sensor** (pin 35)
- **Piezo Buzzer** (pin 25)
- **TRIAC Module** (for universal motor fans) or **VFD** (for induction motor fans)
- **Relay/Optoisolator** (for TRIAC/VFD control)

---

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE** (latest version)
- **Firebase ESP-Client Library** by Mobizt
- **WiFiManager Library**
- **PID_v1 Library**
- **Android Studio** (for app)

---

## Installation

### ESP32 Firmware
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qppd/IoT-Smart-Fan.git
    ```
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**.
    - Install:
       - **Firebase ESP-Client**
       - **WiFiManager**
       - **PID_v1**
3. **Configure Firebase and Wi-Fi**:
    - Edit `firebase_credentials.h` and set your Firebase and Wi-Fi credentials.
4. **Upload the Code**:
    - Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
    - Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.
    - Upload the code to the ESP32.

### Android App
1. Open `source/android/SmartFan` in Android Studio.
2. Add your `google-services.json` to the `app/` directory.
3. Build and run on your device.

## How It Works

### ESP32
1. **Wi-Fi Configuration**: On first boot, ESP32 creates an access point (`SmartFan_AP`). Connect and enter Wi-Fi credentials via the captive portal (WiFiManager).
2. **Sensor Readings**: DHT22 measures temperature/humidity; ACS712 measures current; ZMPT101B measures voltage.
3. **Fan Speed Control (PID)**: PID algorithm adjusts fan speed (PWM) based on temperature. Setpoint and PID parameters are configurable in code.
4. **Buzzer Alerts**: If temperature exceeds setpoint + 2Â°C, buzzer beeps for 300ms.
5. **Data Logging (Firebase)**: All sensor readings and fan control values are sent to Firebase RTDB in real-time. Errors in data upload are printed to serial.
6. **Serial Monitoring**: All values are printed to the serial console for debugging and monitoring.

### Android App
1. **User registers/logs in.**
2. **Links their ESP32-powered fan** using Device ID.
3. **Dashboard displays real-time temperature** (animated gauge) and fan status.
4. **User can control fan manually or enable auto mode.**
5. **Settings and logs** provide further customization and insights.
